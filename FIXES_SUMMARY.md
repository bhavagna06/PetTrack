# 🐕 PetTrack App - Fixes Summary

## ✅ **All Issues Fixed Successfully**

### **🔧 Major Fixes Applied:**

#### **1. Database Schema Fix**
- **Problem**: Phone field had `unique: true` causing duplicate key errors for Google users
- **Solution**: Changed `unique: true` to `unique: false` in User model
- **File**: `backend/models/User.js`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### **2. Backend Pet Routes Fix**
- **Problem**: Invalid ObjectId errors when Firebase UID was used as MongoDB ObjectId
- **Solution**: Added validation to check if ownerId is valid MongoDB ObjectId before using in filter
- **File**: `backend/routes/petRoutes.js`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### **3. Flutter PetService Fix**
- **Problem**: App was sending invalid ownerId (Firebase UID) to backend
- **Solution**: Added validation to only send ownerId if it's a valid 24-character MongoDB ObjectId
- **File**: `lib/services/pet_service.dart`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### **4. User Service Fix**
- **Problem**: `getUserId()` was returning Firebase UID instead of MongoDB `_id`
- **Solution**: Modified to return MongoDB `_id` for backend operations
- **File**: `lib/services/user_service.dart`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### **5. Public Access for Lost/Found Pets**
- **Problem**: Lost and found pets were requiring authentication
- **Solution**: Modified logic to fetch lost/found pets without authentication
- **Files**: `lib/services/pet_service.dart`, `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

#### **6. Database Index Fix**
- **Problem**: Existing database had unique index on phone field
- **Solution**: Dropped problematic index and created non-unique index
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## 📱 **How to Test:**

2. Go to Home screen
3. Should see lost and found pets immediately
4. No login prompt should appear

### **2. Test Google Sign-in:**
1. Click "Sign in with Google"
2. Complete Google authentication
3. Should sign in successfully without errors
4. Check console for successful auth logs

### **3. Test User Functions After Google Login:**
1. After Google sign-in, try:
   - View "My Pets" (should work)
   - Add a new pet (should work)
   - Report lost pet (should work)
   - Report found pet (should work)
   - Edit pet profile (should work)

### **4. Check Console Logs:**
- Look for: `"PetService: Fetching public lost/found pets - no authentication required"`
- No more duplicate key errors
- No more ObjectId casting errors
- Successful backend authentication logs

## 🔍 **Key Console Logs to Look For:**

### **✅ Good (Fixed):**
```
PetService: Fetching pets with params: {page: 1, limit: 20, isLost: true}
PetService: Fetching public lost/found pets - no authentication required
PetService: Response status: 200
AuthService: Backend authentication successful
UserService: Backend session saved locally
```

### **❌ Bad (Before Fix):**
```
Google auth error: MongoServerError: E11000 duplicate key error
Error fetching pets: CastError: Cast to ObjectId failed
